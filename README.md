# Capstone Research: Integrating LiDAR and Optical Imagery for Species-Level Forest Classification
Hello! 

Welcome to my FCOR599 Respository!
 
This repository contains the code, workflow, and outputs for my capstone research project as part of the FCOR 599 course in the Master of Geomatics for Environmental Management (MGEM) program. 

The research aims to explore how combining Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data with optical imagery can enhance species-level forest classification, with a focus on identifying rare species such as Garry Oak (Quercus garryana). The primary objective is to improve the accuracy of forest species identification compared to traditional methods that rely solely on optical imagery.

## Project Overview

The research investigates how integrating the structural information provided by LiDAR with the spectral data from optical imagery can overcome the limitations of optical imagery aloneâ€”specifically, its inability to effectively identify rare and sub-dominant species, such as Garry Oak, due to limitations in spatial resolution and spectral signature overlap between classes.

The study compares LiDAR data collected during leaf-on and leaf-off seasons and assesses how these different datasets impact the identification and classification of Garry Oak. The final classification is performed using a supervised Random Forest classifier implemented in Python. 

The research aims to support Garry Oak conservation but also has broader implications for resource management and conservation by providing a robust method for species identification and ecosystem monitoring.
